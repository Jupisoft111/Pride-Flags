                    return "A-spec, or the a spectrum, is an umbrella term that encompasses both the asexual and aromantic spectra and the many sexual and romantic orientations that are part of them. These orientations involve conditional attractions or experiencing no attraction. It can also be used as an identity term for people who do not differentiate their experiences of conditional or no attraction into separate labels.\r\n\r\nThe term a-spec is short for a spectrum.\r\n\r\nOn Tumblr, an Aceing History blog speculates that the term \"aspec\" may have been used to describe the asexual spectrum in late 2015 or early 2016.\r\n\r\nThe asexual spectrum, abbreviated as acespec, refers to sexual orientations that are asexual or are closely related to asexuality. Identities under the asexual umbrella are closely connected as part of a broad community.\r\n\r\nThe aromantic spectrum, abbreviated as arospec, refers to romantic orientations that are aromantic or are closely related to aromanticism when placed on a spectrum ranging from aromantic to alloromantic.\r\n\r\nIt is also used by people whose aromantic identities are conditional, unreliable, or atypical to societal expectations, and by people who simply do not wish to label it further. Identities under the aromantic umbrella are closely connected as part of a broad community.\r\n\r\nAromantic asexual, also known by the abbreviations aroace and acearo, is a term for someone who experiences little to no romantic or sexual attraction, making them both aromantic and asexual.\r\n\r\nThe a-spec flag was created by Tumblr user The-Moon-Is-Aroace on March 25, 2019. The compass rose in the middle is a symbol of how individuals all experience romantic and sexual attraction in different ways, if at all. The green and purple are on opposite sides of the quadrant to show that asexuality and aromanticism are their own separate and independent identities, with the black and gray quadrants connecting them. Black represents the aroace community and gray represents gray communities.\r\n\r\nThe aloe vera a-spec flag was designed by Tumblr users Sapphic-Squirrel and Hetaces with help from the Inclusionist Discord Server and was posted on November 17, 2019. It was designed to mimic the sapphic, achillean, diamoric, and pluralian flags with three stripes and one plant. The green is for aromantics, the purple for asexuals, and gray for the area between a- and allo- identities.\r\n\r\nThere is some controversy around the term \"aspec\" allegedly being appropriated from the autistic community.\r\n\r\nThe term is sometimes more broadly used to include other identities with the 'a-' prefix, such as agender, though there have also been discussions on how \"aspec\" should only cover the asexual and aromantic spectra.";

This describes all sexual orientations in which one man or man-aligned person is attracted to others, serving as an umbrella term for men and non-binary people who are gay, pansexual, bisexual, queer, or other sexualities in which men or man-aligned individuals identifying as those orientations may be attracted to men and man-aligned people. It is similar to and sometimes known as men loving men (MLM).\r\n\r\nThe term \"achillean\" refers to the Greek hero Achilles. Its 21st century use to describe sexualities is modelled after the term \"sapphic\", which is used to describe all women who are attracted to women.\r\n\r\nAchilles himself is a famous figure in Greek mythology. In relation to sexuality, Achilles had a relationship with another character, Patroclus, which is said to have romantic connotations. In Homer's Iliad, Achilles described Patroclus as being the \"man I loved beyond all other comrades, loved as my own life.\" Their relationship plays a crucial part in the story. After Homer's iteration, the relationship between the men was depicted as a love affair.\r\n\r\nTheocritus' Idyll XXIX, a love poem from a man to a boy, includes a phrase addressing their future: \"ἀλλάλοισι πελώμεθ' Ἀχιλλέιοι φίλοι\" (alláloisi pelómeth' Achilléioi fíloi). It has received loose poetic translations from the Aeolic Greek dialect into English, such as \"we'll be Achilles and his friend,\" \"we may be to one another as Achilles and his friend\" with the meaning noted as \"such friends as were Achilles and Patroclus,\" and \"be friends to each other like Achilles and Patroclus;\" however, the literal translation is \"be Achillean friends to each other.\"\r\n\r\nThe word \"Achillean\" has historically been used to describe all things relating to the aforementioned Achilles. An early use of the term in English to describe sexuality was in John Addington Symonds's 1883 book A Problem in Greek Ethics (chapters III and X). Symonds (1840 – 1893), an English author and advocate of male love, spoke about the \"Achilleian friendship\" as an ideal of manly love, devoid of effeminacy, emphasizing that the love between Achilles and Patroclus had as its most important aspects their loyalty and mutual goodwill. The \"Achilleian friendship\", which for him was synonymous with Greek heroism and Greek love (heroic male-male love), would have ended with the defeat of the hitherto invincible Sacred Band of Thebes, which was composed of 150 pairs of male lovers, against the army of Philip II of Macedon, but Philip's young son and heir Alexander the Great sought to revive it when he and his lover Hephaestion ran naked around the joint tomb of Achilles and Patroclus in Troy to honor their heroes:\r\n\r\n\"At Chaeronea, Greek liberty, Greek heroism, and Greek love, properly so-called, expired. It is not unworthy of notice that the son of the conqueror, young Alexander, endeavoured to revive the tradition of Achilleian friendship. [...] Homer was his invariable companion upon his marches; in the Troad he paid special honour to the tomb of Achilles, running naked races round the barrow in honour of the hero [...]. The historians of his life relate that, while he was indifferent to women, he was madly given to the love of males. This the story of his sorrow for Hephaistion sufficiently confirms.\"\r\n\r\nSee also A.C. Hamilton's 1959 article titled, \"Spenser's Treatment of Myth\":\r\n\r\n\"Guyon subdues these Achillean affections through his own power; but they break out again as Cymochles lapses into lust and Pyrochles burns in the idle lake.\"\r\n\r\nIn ancient Rome and 19th century England, green indicated gay affiliations. Victorian men would often pin a green carnation on their lapel, as popularized by author Oscar Wilde.\r\n\r\nThe first iteration of the achillean flag was created by Tumblr user pridenpositivity in 2016, and this version was later redesigned by DeviantArt user Pride-Flags on October 5, 2016.\r\n\r\nThe word \"achillean\" is often confused for gay or perceived to have the same meaning. However, gay describes a sexuality with attraction to only the same gender. Achillean encompasses all men who are attracted to other men, including men who are also attracted to other genders in addition to men.";

Aegoromantic individuals may have romantic fantasies, enjoy romantic media, or engage in shipping in fandoms, but they tend to feel little to no romantic attraction in real life and typically do not desire a romantic relationship. Oftentimes, their romantic fantasies are viewed from a dissociative third-person perspective, and not from the first person. They usually involve other individuals, such as fictional characters or celebrities with the aegoromantic individual only being a disembodied observer.\r\n\r\nSome common aegoromantic experiences include:\r\n\r\n- Enjoying romantic content, but lacking the same enthusiasm for a romantic relationship in real life.\r\n- Fantasizing about romance, but the aegoromantic individual is not involved, or celebrities, or fictional characters are involved.\r\n- Cannot imagine themselves in a romantic relationship, or doing romantic things, (like kissing and going on romantic dates), or in a marriage, or in living a whole life with someone.\r\n- Fantasizing about romance, but it is idealized and unrealistic. Adding realistic elements to the fantasy makes the idea of romance less appealing or even repulsive.\r\n- Perceiving someone as \"attractive\", yet not seeing the appeal of doing romantic things, like kissing, with the individual in real life. The aegoromantic individual may instead prefer to fantasize about them.\r\n\r\nAegoromantic may be similar to pseudoromantic, which describes an individual who experiences a non-romantic attraction which mimics romantic attraction, often by inducing romantic feelings.\r\n\r\nThe sexual equivalent is aegosexual.\r\n\r\nAegoromantic seems to have first been coined on June 26, 2016, by pride-color-schemes.\r\n\r\nThe aegoromantic flags were coined by pride-color-schemes on June 26, 2016.

                    return "Agender, also known as genderless, can be one of the A terms in the acronym LGBTQIA+. It is a gender identity that has been defined multiple ways, including:\r\n\r\n- Not identifying with any gender, particularly the gender binary; not male, not female, not both or neither.\r\n- Feeling gender neutral.\r\n- The absence of a feeling of gender or lacking gender.\r\n- Rejecting the concept of gender.\r\n- Feeling the concept of gender is personally irrelevant.\r\n\r\nWhile agender is typically considered under the transgender and/or non-binary umbrellas, different individuals may or may not identify with those terms; those who do use them do not need to transition physically, legally, or socially to be agender. Some agender people are genderfluid, meaning their gender identity is not static and changes from being agender. Agender individuals can have any type of gender expression and use any set of pronouns or no pronouns at all just like any other individual can. Agender identities are not exclusive to certain assigned genders at birth or sexual orientations and romantic orientations, just like the majority of the genders that are often or always included in the non-binary and/or transgender umbrellas and the orientation terms used by individuals who are agender may potentially challenge the idea of \"same\" and \"opposite\" gender attraction.\r\n\r\nThe term \"agender\" is comprised of the prefix \"a-\", which comes from the Ancient Greek ἀ-, meaning \"not\" or \"without\", and \"gender\". The literal meaning of the term agender is thus \"genderless\" or \"without gender\".\r\n\r\nAgender Pride Day has been observed each year on May 19 since 2017. As such, it is one of the newer LGBTQIA+ awareness days.\r\n\r\nWhile agender as an identity is not new, the word describing the gender experience, or lack thereof, only surfaced on the internet in 2000 on a forum called UseNet during a religious discussion with someone referring to God as being agender. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term was used again on the same forum 5 years later, this time to refer to people, and from then on, the term started to gain traction. It was used in a profile done by the New York Times of \"Generation LGBTQIA\", and US history was made on March 10, 2017, when the Multnomah County Court of Oregon granted Patch a \"General Judgment of Name and Sex Change\", thus becoming the first, legally agender person in the US. The same judgment also allowed them to change names and become mononymous—meaning only having one name instead of a given name and a surname.\r\n\r\nThe agender flag was created on February 18, 2014, by Salem, who identifies as an agender and panromantic demisexual with they/she pronouns. An artist from New York, they created the flag at a time when Tumblr was seeing an influx of identity expressions, making it hard for people to distinguish the valid identities from the \"online fads\". Capitalizing on the momentum, Salem created the agender flag (among others) to increase visibility for agender identities and reclaim their own identity. The transgender flag served as a primary influence as Salem wanted to have a similar stripe pattern and symmetry.\r\n\r\nThe flag design features 7 horizontal stripes, from top to bottom: black, gray, white, green, white, gray, and black again. The black and white stripes represent the agender experience, the gray the demi-agender experience, and the green refers to agender being part of the wider non-binary community as those who identify outside of the gender binary. While the monochrome on the flag is representative of a spectrum of internal identities, ranging from people with a strong feeling of gender to those without, the green in the middle was deliberately chosen for being the invert of the shade of purple on the non-binary flag that refers to those who relate to the gender binary, as purple is a combination of pink and blue, the traditional female and male colors, thus highlighting that agender does not fall between the binary spectrum at all.\r\n\r\nWhile Salem's design remains the most widespread, more agender flags were created. In 2021, Mars created a four-striped homage to the original, using similar colors and meanings, though with a deliberately higher-contrast design and fewer stripes to emphasize the solidarity of agender people who may also be lesbian, gay, bisexual, non-binary, trans, ace, or any other sexual, romantic, and gender identities. By reducing the repetition of the colors, Mars sent out the message that \"No matter what else we are, all agender people are wholly equally agender.\"\r\n\r\nGender apathy is different from agender in that the individual could be cisgender or non-binary, but they do not care or think about it. People who are gender apathetic are not fazed by gendered comments and do not feel discriminated against for being their gender, even when they are.\r\n\r\nGenderless and agender are sometimes considered separate terms. In definitions that separate them, they are seen as having a strong overlap between the experiences, but with the definition of genderless having a stronger emphasis on completely lacking a gender.\r\n\r\nGender neutral means \"not gendered\", which places it right within the meaning of agender, i.e., \"without a gender\". However, as opposed to agender, gender neutral is not a term used to describe people. This term is used to refer to language (such as pronouns or neutral greeting or job titles), locations (like bathrooms), or other aspects of society.\r\n\r\nThe difference between agender and gender non-conforming people lies in the fact that agender people generally experience a lack of gender whereas a gender non-conforming person is someone who does not fully conform to the expectations around their gender that their society enforces. While some gender non-conforming people may identify as agender, many do not, and they simply do not follow the expected gender norms. This can out itself in the way they express themselves, the roles they assume, or any other aspect of their gender.\r\n\r\nAlthough agender and gendervoid are similar and can be used interchangeably, gendervoid puts more emphasis on feeling like one's gender is literally a void.\r\n\r\nAs non-binary is an umbrella term for all genders falling outside of the gender binary; agender is often placed under this term. However, this does not mean that all non-binary people are agender, as many may experience gender whereas agender people do not.\r\n\r\nNeutrois is a non-binary gender identity with a strong emphasis on gender neutrality. It is considered part of the genderqueer and transgender umbrellas. Some people identify as both agender and neutrois.";

                    return "Androgyne is a gender identity in which a person has a gender that is a blend of both binary genders. People who are androgyne may describe this as being \"between\" female and male, man and woman, masculine and feminine, or simply 'in between.' They may also identify as neither feminine nor masculine, or neither female nor male.\r\n\r\nThe word androgyne is a combination of two Greek words: \"andró\" meaning \"man\", and \"gynḗ\" meaning \"woman\".\r\n\r\nSome people who call themselves androgynes identify with androgynous gender presentations, or have or wish to obtain an androgynous, 'in between', or neutral body. Others see this as only a matter of gender identity and may express their androgynous gender through their personality or activities such as crossdressing. Some, but not all, androgynes experience gender dysphoria. As such, people might not relate to their sex assigned at birth, or find discomfort when others make assumptions regarding their gender or assigned pronouns. They may seek to transition to achieve a more neutral appearing body.\r\n\r\nThey can use any form of pronouns or neopronouns they like, even switching between pronouns (she/her, zhe/zhim) if desired, but most commonly she/her and he/him tend to be used together interchangeably.\r\n\r\nHistorically, androgyne has been a word for an intersex person, and this use of the word is not completely obsolete. However, the sex of a person's body is different than their gender identity. Intersex is a physical sex, and androgyne can mean either that, or a gender identity. The first instance of the term being used as a gender was in 1918, when Jennie June published Autobiography of an Androgyne, which has since been described as \"a centerpiece for queer, trans, and gender studies of twentieth-century America\".\r\n\r\nThere have also been instances of people using the term bisexual to refer to androgynes, androgynous people, or intersex people. An example of the use of this word, found in pop culture, is in the 50th episode of the 2nd season of Star Trek, \"The Trouble with Tribbles\", where Dr. McCoy refers to the tribbles (an alien species) as bisexual.\r\n\r\nThe most common androgyne flag, coined by Tumblr user saveferris on March 29, 2011, has 3 colors. The pink supposedly represents femininity, the blue represents masculinity and the purple represents a combination of the both.\r\n\r\nThere is an alternative flag, designed by pride-flags-for-us on Tumblr, with different colors and meanings behind each color. Androgyne has more of an attachment to the binary genders, thus the black and white of this alternative flag . The blue represents masculinity, and the pink represents femininity. Meanwhile, the purple represents a blending of masculinity and femininity. It also represents androgyne being a non binary identity.\r\n\r\nThe Necker Cube is an optical illusion that can look both concave and convex, first proposed as a symbol for the androgyne community by Raphael Carter in 1996. It is a simple wire-frame, two dimensional drawing of a cube with no visual cues as to its orientation, so it can be interpreted to have either the lower-left or the upper-right square as its front side. For the androgyne community, the Necker Cube is symbolic of the androgynous individual’s physical ambiguity. It is used as an adjusted form of the Necker Cube with a smaller square in the center, as focusing on this square may allow the brain to break out of its cycle between two ‘equally possible interchangeable stable states’ and see the image for what it is; a two dimensional drawing which is neither of the interpreted cubes. Thus the androgyny symbol is itself an example of something that can be taken as one of two binary options or as something else entirely.\r\n\r\nWhile bigender is a gender identity in which a person has or experiences two any co-existing genders, androgyne is a mix of the binary genders in particular. Bigender people have two genders, and these can be any two genders (including androgyne itself), but androgyne is one gender described as a blend of the two binary genders.";

                    return "Asexual refers to people who do not experience sexual attraction toward others. They may experience other forms of attraction, such as romantic, sensual, or aesthetic attraction. Asexuality is a sexual orientation, not a gender identity, behavior, or medical condition. Some asexual people choose to engage in sexual activities for various reasons despite not experiencing sexual feelings and desire toward any particular person. Asexuality is part of the asexual spectrum (abbreviated \"ace spectrum\"), an umbrella term and a broad community of identities that are closely related to asexuality when placed on a spectrum ranging from asexual to sexual.\r\n\r\nThe term 'asexual' comes from the negation prefix a-, meaning 'not' or 'without', with the word 'sexual'. It was initially used to describe biological organisms that had no sex organs or reproduction without sex. Its use as a label was popularized by Alfred Kinsey in his Heterosexual-Homosexual Rating Scale (the Kinsey scale), with X being used to denote people who did not engage in sexual behaviors.\r\n\r\nThe asexual community is small but growing. Asexuality is part of the asexual spectrum and has been broadly categorized, along with aromanticism, as part of the a-spec(trum). The asexual community has close ties to the aromantic community due to their commonalities. The community of people who are both asexual and aromantic is known as the aroace community.\r\n\r\nMembers of the asexual community have noted that \"asexual identities make explicit a romantic dimension of sexuality as distinct from a sexual identity based on lack of sexual attraction\" as compared with non-asexual identities. In researched cases, this resulted in greater emphasis being put on an individuals' sexual and romantic orientation as contrasted with non-asexual peers.\r\n\r\nAsexuals challenge the idea that sex is the best, easiest, or only route to achieving intimacy or connections with others. The experiences of asexuals call into question normative assumptions about the relationships between sex, physical closeness, romantic experience, and interpersonal intimacy, demonstrating there are a variety of ways to create meaningful intimate bonds with others that do not focus on sex or even necessarily on romantic connections.\r\n\r\nThere are many key signs that someone might be asexual; however, asexuality is a spectrum, and not all of these will apply to all asexual people:\r\n\r\n- No interest in sex or intimacy.\r\n- Finding others attractive, but not being attracted to them.\r\n- Enjoying hugging/kissing, but don't want to take things further.\r\n- Finding sex scenes boring.\r\n\r\nBecause modern asexual organizing has largely happened on the internet, some commentators have defined asexuality as the first \"internet orientation.\" However, explicit references to the asexual identity can be traced back to the early 20th century. One of the first modern gay activists in the U.S., Carl Schlegel, issued pleas for queer equality that specifically invoked asexuality in a speech composed in 1907. The famous sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld also used the term in “The Role of Homosexual Men and Women in Society” in 1920.\r\n\r\nFast-forward half a century, and the emerging literature on queer identity made frequent references to asexuality. In 1952, the magazine Transvestia used the term \"asexual\", and in 1965 published a short description of what it termed the “A-sexual Range”, perhaps an early prototype of the asexual spectrum. Many feminist conferences in the 1970s let people choose a label for their sexual identity, and asexual was one of the options.\r\n\r\nIllinois State University professor Ela Przybylo, in her book Asexual Erotics, highlighted a feminist effort in the 1960s and 1970s to swear off sex. The rise of these sexual critiques inspired one feminist, Lisa Orlando, to publish “The Asexual Manifesto” in 1972. Although Orlando’s interpretation of asexuality is largely framed as a political reaction to the patriarchy, she does mention avoiding sex and feeling her need for sex to diminish, as well as seeing sex as a way of avoiding closeness rather than achieving it. “The Asexual Manifesto\" struck a chord with people who more closely matched today’s understanding of asexuality, and even prompted the gay liberationist Greg Turner to cite it in a 1976 essay outlining his search for an identity label.\r\n\r\nIn 1971, the Village Voice published what it intended to be a parody article titled “Asexuals Have Problems Too!,” but the article prompted a flurry of letters to the newspaper and suggested a widespread curiosity about asexual identity. Soon after, queer zines began making occasional references to asexual identity. In the ’80s and ’90s, punk zines that surveyed their readers accounted for the asexual demographic. Also in the ’90s, asexual people began exploring their identities themselves in riot grrrl zines. There are likely more than 100 zines either wholly focused on or containing discussion of the ace umbrella, and these zines paved the way for the recognition of asexuality as a distinct sexual identity.\r\n\r\nMost asexual people credit writer Zoe O’Reilly’s 1997 essay, “My life as an amoeba,” with creating the first contemporary asexual community. Before O’Reilly’s piece was published on the now-defunct website StarNet Dispatches.\r\n\r\nFour years later, in October 2000, a Yahoo! Group “Haven for the Human Amoeba” was established as place where asexual people could find each other online. However, the biggest breakthrough for the community came in March 2001, when a freshman at Wesleyan University named David Jay launched what is today called the Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN). It is a website, wiki, and forum that has connected thousands of asexual people across the world.\r\n\r\nAce Week, formerly known as Asexual Awareness Week, was founded by Sara Beth Brooks in 2010 with the help of AVEN founder David Jay. It takes place annually the final week of October, and its purpose is to spread educational materials, organize community events, and discuss asexual experiences.\r\n\r\nThe very first Ace Week was mostly conducted online through blogging and social media activity. As part of the campaign to increase asexual awareness within the LGBTQ+ community, members of the asexual community created one minute \"Dear LGBT Community\" video letters to share on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Asexuals were also encouraged to share information and experiences on social media, change their profile pictures, and start conversations about being asexual both online and off.\r\n\r\nAce Week took a huge leap forward in 2011. Sara Beth formed a 20-person committee that planned and collaborated on the project over the course of 6 months. In addition to focusing on the LGBTQ+ community, the second Ace Week targeted mass media, educational organizations, medical professionals, and sex-positive communities.\r\n\r\nMany traditions have developed in celebration of Ace Week, including the Fandom Challenge, which first took place in 2014. On each day of Ace Week, the Fandom Challenge sets out a prompt designed to initiate discussions on social media about canon and headcanon asexual characters.\r\n\r\nThe asexual pride flag was voted on by the Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN) in 2010. It is composed of four horizontal stripes from top to bottom in the colors black, grey, white, and purple. The colors have the following meanings:\r\n\r\n- Black: Asexuals.\r\n- Grey: Demisexuals and grayasexuals.\r\n- White: Sexuals, as in non-asexual partners and allies.\r\n- Purple: The community.\r\n\r\nAromantic (or \"aro\") people do not experience romantic attraction toward others. Some aromantic people experience sexual attraction, while others are both aromantic and asexual.\r\n\r\nAsexuality is not the same as celibacy or abstinence, which are choices to not engage in sexual behavior based on reasons that are not related to sexual attraction. People who abstain from sex may experience sexual attraction and choose not to act upon it, and they may change their minds and become sexually active. Asexuality is not a personal choice that can be changed; it is an orientation. Someone who chooses to practice celibacy, whether for personal or religious beliefs, is not necessarily asexual. Some asexuals may abstain from sex, while others have sex for various reasons, such as the desire to have children or for intimacy with a partner.\r\n\r\nAsexuality is not inceldom (\"involuntary celibacy\"), an online subculture that is associated with misogyny.\r\n\r\nAlthough demisexuality is on the asexual spectrum, it is different from asexuality itself. Asexual people do not experience sexual attraction, regardless of how close they are with someone, whereas demisexual people can and do experience sexual attraction, but only after a close bond is formed with another person.\r\n\r\nNonlibidoist refers to a person who does not experience sexual urges/desires or masturbate. This differs from asexual in that asexual people can still experience sexual arousal, but not attraction. Although some asexual people simply ignore feelings of sexual arousal, others may masturbate in response or seek out sex for the physical pleasure.\r\n\r\nHyposexuality, unlike asexuality, is a disorder, and is characterized by a reduced libido and difficulty becoming sexually aroused.\r\n\r\nAlthough further research is needed, asexual people may be the target of more prejudice, avoidance, and discrimination relative to cisgender and heterosexual people, and possibly to cisgender lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. Asexual people have been perceived as experiencing fewer human emotions and dehumanized by being characterized as both \"machine-like\" and \"animal-like.\"\r\n\r\nAsexual people can face prejudice from within the LGBTQ+ community, such as being refused entry to LGBTQ+ spaces, receiving inappropriate treatment from LGBTQ+ services, or being excluded from the LGBTQ+ umbrella. One belief is that the inclusion of asexuals and aromantics in the community will cause others to lose access to needed resources.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of misunderstandings when it comes to asexuality. It does not necessarily mean having an aversion to sex or fear of sex, although some asexuals do. A common myth is that people \"become\" asexual after either being sexually rejected or sexually abused. Asexuality is a natural orientation that is generally unrelated to traumatic experiences a person may have suffered. Some asexual people may experience changes in their desire or attraction due to trauma, but trauma and mental health are not exclusive and decisive \"causes\" of asexuality or other sexual orientations. Some asexuals may know their orientation from an early age, while others may not discover they are asexual until after one or more sexual experiences.\r\n\r\nAnother myth is that asexuality is caused by a hormone deficiency. Asexual people who have their hormone levels tested are generally found to be within normative ranges. Some asexuals have received hormone therapy for reasons unrelated to their sexuality, but they have not reported changes in their sexual orientation. Available evidence does not support the conclusion that asexuality is caused by hormone imbalances or deficient sex drives.\r\n\r\nMany asexual individuals report experiencing sexual harassment and violence, including corrective rape, designed to eradicate their asexuality. In the 2015 asexual community census, a volunteer-run project, 43.5% of nearly 8,000 asexuals surveyed reported having experienced some form of sexual violence. These crimes occur because people see asexuality as a \"challenge\", and they believe they can \"change the person's mind\" or \"fix their orientation\".\r\n\r\nAsexuals frequently experience verbal abuse and violence from neighbors or strangers, in person or online. This can include:\r\n\r\n- Saying there is something “wrong” with the victim or that the victim is “broken” because they are asexual.\r\n- Telling the victim that something is “wrong” with their body, and that is why they are asexual.\r\n- Mocking the victim’s body or making the victim feel bad about their body responding or not responding to sexual acts.\r\n- Telling the victim that they are asexual or are confused about being asexual because no one wants to have a relationship or sex with them.\r\n- Threatening to tell the victim’s friends, family, or coworkers about their asexuality without their permission.\r\n- Stopping or forbidding the victim from speaking to other asexual people, talking about asexuality, or attending in-person or online support groups for asexual people.\r\n\r\nMany asexual people are wary of coming out because they fear they may face interrogation from people who don’t believe them.";

The genders may be any combination of two genders, and those genders can be binary (\"man\" or \"woman\") or non-binary. They may be experienced simultaneously or may alternate, and they may not be experienced equally or in the same way. For example, a bigender person may be both a woman and a man, agender and neutrois, or non-binary and a woman. Bigender is an identity under the transgender umbrella.\r\n\r\nEarly examples of the term 'bigender' appear as early as the late 1980s, though at this time it was grouped under the \"androgyne\" label as \"bigenderist\". Definitions were rooted in the expression of \"either gender role\" or as \"having two genders\".\r\n\r\nSome, but not all, of bigender people experience gender dysphoria, especially if the two genders have markedly different gender expressions. As such, people might not relate to their sex assigned at birth, or find discomfort when others make assumptions regarding their gender or assigned pronouns.\r\n\r\nThey can use any form of pronouns or neopronouns they like, even switching between pronouns (she/her, xe/xem) if desired. Some bigender people are not specific about their pronouns due to the duality of their gender. However, some bigender individuals express their gender through the use of drag, as it allows them to express both the genders they relate to. They may also feel or express a mixture of being masculine and feminine at the same time.\r\n\r\nBigender Pride Day is held on June 17.\r\n\r\nThe term bigender came into use in the 1980s, but rose in popularity and use through the online website Tumblr. The social media app Facebook has an option for users to select \"bigender\" when joining the app.\r\n\r\nThe most known bigender flag was created by Tumblr user no-bucks-for-this-doe. The flag consists of two different pink stripes, a deep pink followed by the traditional depiction of pink. From there, a lilac stripe, a white stripe, and another lilac stripe. The last two stripes are baby blue followed by a deep blue. The exact meanings of each color were not specified when coined, though some assumptions have been made. One theory is that the pink stripes represent femininity, blue represents masculinity, purple represents a combination of male and female or androgyny, and the center white stripe represents non-binary.\r\n\r\nAn alternate version of the bigender flag exists, though the creator is currently unknown as well as the meanings behind each stripe. It is assumed that the colors have the same meaning as the original flag, and that the yellow is added to represent non-binary, those whose gender exists outside the gender binary.\r\n\r\nBigender is different than genderfluid, which describes people who can switch between their genders, or whose gender identity fluctuates. Bigender people typically only identify as two genders. They do not experience a third or fluid gender identity outside of their set two. It is possible to identify as both bigender and genderfluid. However, while a genderfluid person moves between genders, a bigender person feels statically attached to their two genders.\r\n\r\nBigender is also different than non-binary, with non-binary serving as the larger umbrella term for bigender people. A non-binary individual does not identify with either binary of male or female, while a bigender person can. They can also identify as both a binary identity and a non-binary identity.";

Bisexuals may feel equally attracted or may be primarily attracted or more strongly attracted to one or more of them compared to the other(s). Bisexuality is also an umbrella term for multiple attractions, the definitions of which overlap. Individuals may have a preference in which specific label they use or draw distinctions between bisexuality and other labels, such as pansexual and omnisexual.\r\n\r\n\"Bisexual\" comes from the roots \"bi-\", meaning \"two\" or \"double\", and \"-sexual\". The term \"bisexuality\", when referring to sexual orientation, was first used by neurologist Charles Gilbert Chaddock in his English translation of Psychopathia Sexualis in 1892, which contained a theory that the brain of a person attracted both to their own sex and the opposite sex must be partly of another sex and thus \"hermaphroditic\". Earlier, it was a botanical term for \"having male and female parts\".\r\n\r\nBi Visibility Day has been internationally celebrated on September 23 since 1999. It varies in several countries, though, being the 16th, 24th, or 25th instead.\r\n\r\nIn Ancient China and Japan, homosexuality and bisexuality were both documented, including both men who had sex with men, and women who had sex with women. Ancient Japanese art prints, called shunga, depict sexual relationships in complex detail, including same-sex relations. Ancient China had similar artwork. Ancient Greek religious texts, which reflected cultural practices, had bisexual themes throughout. Ancient Greece is generally considered to have been accepting of LGBTQIA+ individuals, though attitudes differed in various city-states. In terms of social acceptance in ancient Rome, a freeborn Roman man could have sex with both men and women, as long as he took the penetrative role. Caligula, a Roman Caesar, had relationships with both men and women.\r\n\r\nStarting from 19th century, historians documented multiple self-declared or openly living as bisexual historical figures, being able to describe them in more detail than ancient figures. These include several well-known writers, singers and artists; however, living openly as a bisexual person was rare due to stigma. The famous writer Hans Christian Andersen (1805 - 1875) is described to be bisexual, as he describes attraction to both men and women in his correspondence and diary; his male love interests include Edvard Collin, who preferred women and found himself \"unable to respond to this love\". Lord Byron (1788 - 1824), an English poet, one of the leading figures of the Romanticism, had many relationships with women and men, and his bisexuality is acknowledged by historians.\r\n\r\nDuring the Harlem Renaissance, blues singers Ma Rainey (1886–1939) and Bessie Smith (1894–1937) openly acknowledged bisexuality in their lyrics and life and are considered bisexual. Poet Edna St. Vincent Millay (1892–1950) was also openly bisexual.\r\n\r\nThe sex researcher Alfred Kinsey and his team published the Kinsey Scale in 1948, to illustrate that sexual attraction and behavior can vary on a wide spectrum. The seven-point scale ranges from 0 (\"exclusively heterosexual\") to 6 (\"exclusively homosexual\"). Those who fall somewhere in the 1-5 category are labelled as bisexual. The scale shows that there is a whole range of experiences other than being heterosexual or homosexual.\r\n\r\nIn New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. between 1965 and 1969 multiple pickets were staged to fight for LGBTQIA+ rights. One woman at the second White House picket declared herself as bisexual. Many bisexual individuals took part in the Stonewall riots in 1969, a key historical event for the entire LGBTQIA+ community. Brenda Howard, a known bisexual activist, is known as the Mother of Pride, because she created a one-month Stonewall anniversary rally in July 1969 and then took part in coordinating the Christopher Street Liberation Day Parade in 1970, known as the first pride march.\r\n\r\nIn 1972, a Quaker group (an American religious assembly), the Committee of Friends on Bisexuality, supported the bisexual people in the \"Ithaca Statement on Bisexuality\", being the possibly first know religious group to support the bisexual community in the United States.\r\n\r\nFreddie Mercury (1946 - 1991) is one of the most famous self-declared bisexual men. Many speculate about his sexuality, but it is known he came out to his girlfriend, Mary Austin, in 1976.\r\n\r\nThe Klein Grid is a way to describe sexuality and it is also known as the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid (KSOG). The psychiatrist and sex researcher Fritz Klein published the Klein Grid in 1978 to provide a more nuanced way to describe human sexuality. It includes past and present experiences and one's \"ideal\" experience they'd wish to have, and multiple labels to describe the experiences. One can include their behavior, attraction, fantasies, lifestyle and preferences and describe them with a multitude of labels containing words \"only\", \"somewhat more\", \"most\" and such. The grid illustrates fluidity and complexity of everyone's sexual identity.\r\n\r\nWhen the HIV/AIDS pandemic began, bisexual activists fought for their recognition; they also fought for cisgender women, transgender people, and injection drug users to be recognized as victims of the pandemic and supported. One of them was a Black woman, Veneita Porter, who advocated for these groups and was known to be bisexual; she was an activist of the Prostitute's Union of Massachusetts and the Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics organization. In 1985, the Bisexual Resource Center (BRC) was founded as the East Coast Bisexual Network. In 1987, the article \"The Bisexual Movement: Are We Visible Yet?\" by Lani Ka'ahumanu appeared in the official Civil Disobedience Handbook for the Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights and was the first article from the bisexual community in a national lesbian or gay publication in the United States of America.\r\n\r\nIn 1992, Colorado voters approved the 1992 Colorado Amendment 2 that prevented any city, town, or county in the state from taking any legislative, executive, or judicial action to introduce anti-discrimination law protecting gay, lesbian, or bisexual people. The Supreme Court ruled in a 6–3 decision that the amendment did not satisfy the Equal Protection Clause.\r\n\r\nThe Union for Reform Judaism in 2003 issued a resolution \"Support for the Inclusion and Acceptance of the Transgender and Bisexual Communities\", which applied their policy supporting rights of the gay and lesbian communities to the bisexual and transgender communities.\r\n\r\nThe bisexual pride flag was designed by a team led by LGBT activist Michael Page in 1998. The flag was created in order to give the bisexual community its own symbol which was easily recognized and comparable to the gay pride flag (rainbow flag) that represented the larger LGBTQIA+ community. Page's aim was to increase the visibility of bisexual people, both among society as a whole and within the community.\r\n\r\nPage took the colors of the bisexual pride flag from an existing bisexual symbol, the biangles (bisexuality triangles). The biangles were created for the Boston Bi Woman's Community by the artist Liz Nania.\r\n\r\nThe pink color represents sexual attraction to the same sex only (gay and lesbian). The blue represents sexual attraction to the opposite sex only (straight) and the resultant overlap color purple represents sexual attraction to both sexes (bi).\r\n\r\nA number of bisexual people prefer to use the bisexual crescents (also called the double moon) instead of the bi triangles as their community symbol, as they want to avoid using a symbol that derives from the pink triangle, which was used to tag and persecute homosexual people in the Nazi regime. This symbol was created by Vivian Wagner with a team in 1998.\r\n\r\nDepending on the definitions used for the terms, bisexuality may be distinct from, but similar, to pansexuality and omnisexuality. This is apparent when defining bisexuality as attraction to more than one gender, pansexuality as attraction regardless of gender to people of any gender, and omnisexuality as attraction to all genders with gender often still playing a role in those attractions. However, the definitions are very nuanced and can vary per person.\r\n\r\nBisexual (\"bi\") erasure is one of the most common ways to discriminate against bisexual people. It is the practice of obscuring or denying a bisexual individual's orientation, often in favor of portraying them as either gay/lesbian or straight. It remains common, and despite efforts from bisexual activists, the cisheteronormative perception of the gender binary continues to affect how bisexuals are perceived.\r\n\r\nThere is a tendency to ignore the existence of bisexuality and assume that a person who has a same-sex relationship or sexual intercourse once is homosexual. However, a study in 2012 found that 76.8% of participants categorized such people as bisexual. Still, they \"perceived male targets (who expressed a one-time interest in the other sex) to be more homosexual than comparable female targets were judged to be\". Another study, published in 2021, mentioned that the authors researched the suggestion that \"people stereotype bisexual women as truly heterosexual and bisexual men as truly gay\" and found that \"participants all perceived bisexual men as more attracted to men than to women. No such pattern emerged for bisexual women\".";

The exact definition and name may not have stabilized, and may change significantly as more people identify with it.\r\n\r\nCeteroromantic, also sometimes referred to as skolioromantic, is a romantic orientation where a person is romantically attracted to non-binary genders.\r\n\r\nThe prefix cetero- that is used in ceteroromantic comes from the Latin world \"ceterus\", which means \"the other, the rest\". In this case, it is meant to represent the other genders that a ceteroromantic person is attracted to outside of the gender binary.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the skolio- prefix used in the alternate term skolioromantic means \"crooked\" or \"bent\".\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest flag designs for ceteroromantic was published on May 10, 2016. This flag version seems to have been based off another flag design, but unfortunately the origins of the original design have since been lost.

It is not treated as an orientation, but instead an identity label that can be used alongside an actual orientation label. Diamoric is thus fairly different from ceteroromantic and skolioromantic, however it is often suggested as an alternative to those terms due to the controversies associated with them.\r\n\r\nCeteroromantic shares many of the same controversies and concerns as ceterosexual, largely due to the original skolioromantic term, as well as discussions on who should be able to use the term. The main problem with the old term skolioromantic is that the prefix skolio- means bent or crooked. As a result, many people dislike the use of this prefix due to its definition, since its use for an orientation can imply that non-binary people and/or skiloromantic people are \"unnatural, wrong, or \"twisted\" in some way\". This is the main reason why the alternative term using the prefix \"cetero\" became more widely used.\r\n\r\nSome trans people see ceteroromantic/skolioromantic as a term that can be used to fetishize non-binary people, especially when used by a cis person. Due to this, many believe that this term should only be used by non-binary people to describe their romantic attraction towards other non-binary people.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the previous section, this term is often seen as being restricted to non-binary people, with cis people facing judgement if they chose to use this label for themselves.";

As an identity word for non-binary people, it can be used to describe their sexual or romantic orientations, rather than being a specific orientation term of its own, or used to describe their relationships. Some non-binary people use it to emphasize their own gender identity and their attractions or relationships with other non-binary people.

Diamoric can also describe relationships in which one or more of the partners is non-binary, including relationships where one of the members is binary.\r\n\r\nThe word diamoric is a neologism from the Greek prefix dia-, meaning \"passing through, thoroughly, completely, or going apart from\", and the Latin word amor, meaning \"love\".

In a broader sense of the word, gay can also be used as an umbrella term to identify any LGBTQIA+ individual, though some note that doing so excludes other sexual orientations and gender identities and should thus be avoided.\r\n\r\n\"Gay\" as an identity is defined by the attraction and self-identification as such rather than having had any sexual experience with people of the same gender. Thus, having had sexual intercourse with someone of the same gender does not make anyone gay by definition. There is not just one way to experience same-sex attraction, nor is there a set period in life to discover that you experience it. While some may know that they experience same-sex attraction from a young age, it can take others decades to figure it out or be comfortable enough with their identity to acknowledge it to themselves and others.\r\n\r\nBeing gay is also referred to as \"homosexuality\" and thus forms the counterpart of \"heterosexuality\", the sexual attraction to individuals of the opposite gender. However, controversy has arisen surrounding the use of the word \"homosexuals\" to refer to gay people, as it has been considered an outdated term that is derogatory and offensive to many lesbian and gay people due to its usage by anti-LGBTQIA+ individuals to imply that gay people are somehow diseased or psychologically/emotionally disordered.\r\n\r\nThe word \"homosexuality\" comes from the Greek homos, which means \"the same\".\r\n\r\nThe word \"gay\" has had many meanings over the years. Dating back to the 12th century, it came from the Old French word \"gai\", meaning \"joyful, happy; pleasant, agreeably charming; forward, pert; light-colored\" and was a commonly used term within literature.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the 1600s that the term took on a sexual meaning. By then, the \"carefree\" nature of the word became used to refer to people with unrestrained morals and prone to decadence and promiscuity; as such, a prostitute became known as a \"gay woman\", a womanizer as a \"gay man\", and a brothel as a \"gay house\".\r\n\r\nThis trend continued, as in the 1890s, the term \"gey cat\", which is a Scottish variant of gay, was used to refer to a \"vagrant who offered sexual services to women or a young traveler who was new to the road and in the company of an older man.\" This marked one of the first times that \"gay\" was used to imply a same-gender relationship.\r\n\r\nBy the 1960s, gay men had taken to the term to refer to their own sexual identity, and by today's standards, it is the acceptable way to refer to homosexual people.\r\n\r\nWhile the linguistic concepts of \"homosexuality\" and other gender and sexuality related terms may be new, the orientations and identities themselves are not.\r\n\r\nThe rainbow flag and its variations is one of the most well-known and used symbols for the entire LGBTQIA+ community and frequently flown during Pride events. Originally created by Gilbert Baker with 8 stripes in 1978 to be used for the first time during the June 25, 1978, Freedom Day Parade in San Francisco, Baker dropped the pink and turquoise due to fabric shortages toward the end of 1978 and a desire to split the motif in two with an even number of stripes flanking each streetlamp along the parade route in 1979, respectively. It is this version that became the standard for future production as well as the symbol for gay men.\r\n\r\nMuch lesser known than its rainbow companion, the modern gay men's pride flag was posted in 2019 on the Tumblr blog gayflagblog as an update of a prior gay men flag. It features an array of green, blue, and purple shades to be representative of a wide range of gay men, regardless of their gender, thus also including, but not being limited to, gay men who are transgender, non-binary, gender non-conforming, aromantic, or asexual. This version replaced the original one that only used blue tones, as it was regarded as a stereotypical representation of the gender binary and lacked meaning for the colors used. Inspired by Gilbert Baker and the responses to the blue flag, the individual stripes used by gayflagblog mean:\r\n\r\n- Green: Community.\r\n- Teal: Healing.\r\n- Light teal/green: Joy.\r\n- White: Gender non-conforming, non-binary, and trans men.\r\n- Light blue: Pure love.\r\n- Purple: Fortitude.\r\n- Indigo: Diversity.\r\n\r\nThe combination of green and teal also represents nature, in defiance of the perception of love between men as \"unnatural\". Green also draws upon the use of green plants and flowers, specifically carnations and hyacinths. The use of white was derived from the Trans Pride Flag to explicitly represent identities that are often erased and the need to address and resolve transphobia, internalized homophobia, and toxic masculinity. The light blue leading into purple was inspired by criticism of the blue flag (\"oh blue for boy? bleh\") and symbolizes how gay men may or may not be stereotypical, in-between, or fluid. The purple and indigo together represent diversity in presentation, relationships, and life experience; not fitting into neat categories, \"especially by those who choose to fetishize us & by non-MLM, but in reality there are so so many different ways to be a man and so many ways to be a man who loves or who is in a relationship with other men, and this needs to be emphasized\".\r\n\r\nOne of the many gay subcultures, a \"bear\" is generally speaking a large-build, hairy man over 30 years old. Hunky, chunky, often with bellies, big legs, big butts, and almost always with a full beard or facial hair, \"bears\" are often attributed the general stereotype of \"traditional masculinity\", a notion that is strengthened by some bear clubs and bars not being open to women, twinks, transgender people, etc. However, being a bear is about appearance and has thus nothing to do with identity and mannerisms.\r\n\r\nTo represent this subculture of masculine-presenting gay, bisexual, and trans men who embrace facial and body hair and may have larger bodies, the colorful bear flag was created by psychology undergraduate Craig Byrnes in 1995. As opposed to other flags representing a gender identity of sexual/romantic orientation, the colors of this flag are reminiscent of the fur color from the different bear animals, thus consisting of varying shades of brown, white, and black.\r\n\r\nAs with all identities, the definition depends on the person asked, but broadly stated, a \"twink\" can be defined as a thin, smaller-built, and pretty smooth person with little to no body hair and usually someone in their late teens-early twenties or someone who looks younger than their age. Due to their built, twinks are often wrongfully assumed to be camp and effeminate, shy and insecure, and clueless when it comes to sexual acts. This often leads to a hypersexualization of people fitting the mold and a problematic media representation as playthings and not-to-be-taken-serious sexual objects.\r\n\r\nThis sub-community has no physical flag representation, though a design has been made and is circulating online. There is no concrete definition, though the general assumption is that the pink is a celebration of the effeminate nature many twinks are attributed with, and the pastel is reminiscent of a youthful, bright aura. While the twink culture is large and popular, the flag has not received that same popularity and has not received much attention as for example the bear pride flag has.\r\n\r\nGay is generally used to define a man being attracted to another man, or a woman to another woman if she does not prefer to use the term lesbian, whereas queer is a broader term to refer to people who are not heterosexual and/or cisgender.\r\n\r\nHowever, since gay can also be used as an umbrella term for the LGBTQIA+ community, gay and queer are sometimes used as synonyms by some, despite having a distinct meaning for others.\r\n\r\nWhen used in the broad sense of the word, whether one identifies as gay or queer, it is up to them. Some reasons to prefer one over the other:\r\n\r\n- Just like \"gay\", queer has a negative history, and while it is a reclamation for some, it is still a slur for others that means \"strange\" or \"peculiar\" and is used to describe non-heterosexual desires and behaviors in a derogatory way.\r\n- There is still a lot of erasure of people of color, gender non-conforming, non-binary, and other in either \"gay\" or \"queer\" places.\r\n- Gay and queer have a different connotation when it comes to sex, as being gay in the sexual sense refers to the activity with someone of the same sex and thus implies a defines idea about one's own gender and that of their partner. Queer does not necessarily imply that.\r\n\r\nThere has been controversy surrounding the use of the word \"homosexual\" to refer to gay people, as it has been considered an outdated term that is derogatory and offensive to many lesbian and gay people.\r\n\r\nBefore \"homosexuality\" became a word, same-sex relationships were referred to as \"sodomy\", derived from Latin Sodoma, the name of the town in the biblical tale of Sodom and Gomorrah. In the Book of Genesis (19), these cities were said to be depraved, so their destruction by fire was seen as a divine judgment from God. Since \"sodom\" became synonymous with \"homosexuality\", it resulted in a long history of criminalization of the gay sexual activity, especially between men; punishments went as far as death sentences.\r\n\r\nThe biblical tale of Sodom and Gomorrah also left some people to consider that being gay is a sin, even though the relevant passages never explicitly identified gay sex as the reason the cities were destroyed. Conservative Christians also believe that God created men and women to, among other things, procreate, which is biologically impossible with gay sex and therefor forbidden. There are several passages in the Bible that some deliberately interpret to corroborate this belief, though this interpretation is already challenged by the fact that it is only the modern translations, starting from 1946, that explicitly refer to gay people, as the original words do not. These modern translations gave \"homosexuality\", a term which did not emerge until 1869, when it was used by Hungarian journalist Károli Mária Kertbeny, a negative connotation, turning it into a slur.\r\n\r\nThis association with anti-gay attitudes led gay people to reject the term and especially its negative implications. The word was further demonized due consisting of the prefix \"homo\", which was used as a slur, and the word \"sex\", thus placing the emphasis of gay relationships on having sex.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the word \"homosexuality\" appeared in medical journals where it was pathologized as a \"disease\", \"sickness\", \"defect\", \"disorder\", and/or as a mental illness. Same-sex attraction has been labeled a danger to society, traditional family values, and children in particular, as well as associated with several sexual perversions. There was a predominant idea that homosexuality has a neurological cause and could therefore be \"cured\". \"Treatments\" ranged from psychiatric treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral techniques, electroconvulsive therapy, and even a lobotomy, to surgical attempts to change sexual orientation with hormone treatments and subjecting people to invasive surgical procedures such as hysterectomy, vasectomy, and castration. It was not until 1973 that the American Psychiatric Association removed \"homosexuality\" from its list of mental disorders in the second edition of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. However, until this day, some of these misconceptions still persists in some communities.\r\n\r\nThe LGBTQIA+ community was also one of the many victims of Nazi Germany, as gay men had a downward-pointing pink triangle sewn onto their shirts in the concentration camps. It was not until the 1970s that the symbol was reclaimed as a symbol of gay pride.\r\n\r\nDue to this loaded history and its aggressive use by the anti-LGBTQIA+ people that still maintain that homosexuality is a sin or a disease or a psychological/emotional disorder, it is GLAAD's recommendation to forgo the use of \"homosexual\" except in direct quotes. However, some uphold that the term has been reclaimed by the LGBTQIA+ community and can be used colloquially within the community though non-LGBTQIA+ people should avoid using the term.\r\n\r\nLiving in a heteronormative society, not falling within the societal norms often gives people the impression that they need to \"come out\", which is defined as a \"lifelong process of self-identifying and self-acceptance.\" There are many different degrees of being out and the journey of self-discovery can take a lifetime. Coming out can be an incredible personal and transformative experience, allowing the person to develop as a whole individual and make it easier to foster a positive self-image, as they no longer need to hide whom they really are to others.\r\n\r\nHowever, since heteronormativity still rules society, it is only the members of the LGBTQIA+ community who feel this need, as they are otherwise perceived to be heterosexual and/or cisgender until proven otherwise, and there are still some risks involved with coming out, as not everyone will be understanding and accepting. As such, it is not always easy and no one should feel pressured to come out if they are not ready. If and when, or even at all, and to whom someone comes out is entirely up to each person individually to decide.\r\n\r\nDespite being the accepted term to refer to homosexual people, by the 1990s, it took on a more derogative meaning of \"stupid\" or \"undesirable\" and can be used to refer to people as illicit, counterculture, or behaving unrespectable to societal norms, thus carrying a history of negative judgment. However, there is an ongoing effort by the LGBTQIA+ community to reclaim the word \"gay\" as positive. Anyone can help this effort by simply refraining from using the word \"gay\" themselves when they wish to denote something negative.\r\n\r\nHomophobia refers to hatred, dislike, animosity of LGBTQIA+ individuals that often manifests itself in the form of prejudice and bias, and it is still illegal to be gay in many countries.\r\n\r\nThe International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, and Biphobia is held each year on May 17 with the first celebration having been in 2004. This date was deliberately chosen to commemorate the World Health Organization's decision in 1990 to declassify homosexuality as a mental disorder. The goal of this day is to draw the attention of decision-makers, the media, the public, opinion leaders, and local authorities to the violence and discrimination experienced by LGBTQIA+ people, as homophobia often stems from a lack of knowledge and has thus led to the spreading of harmful myths to discredit the community, such as:\r\n\r\n- LGBTQIA+ members make bad parents.\r\n\r\nA study from 2014 has indicated that there are few differences in family structure or social development between same-sex parent households and opposite-sex parent households.\r\n\r\n- Being gay is a choice and can be fixed.\r\n\r\nSexuality has been commonly accepted by most scientists to be the result of several factors, including biology and environment, and thus any effort to change one's sexuality through conversion therapy or any other \"treatments\" is potentially harmful for the individual. Being gay is not a mental disorder or anything that the individual can control.\r\n\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic is a worldwide health crisis involving the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a virus that attacks the immune system, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a severe phase that may occur when the immune system is badly damaged by HIV.

Gender fluidity recognizes no borders or rules of gender.\" This sentiment is echoed, though not repeated, by transgender advocate Michael M. Hernandez, who wrote 1996: Gender-fluid means that their gender identity and/or expression encompass both masculine and feminine. Gender fluidity is becoming commonly known as transgenderism: the ability to transcend gender, whether biological, emotional, political, or otherwise; truly mixing male and female. These definitions are less applicable to genderfluidity as it has become known in the 21st century. A definition of the term appears in Kirstin Cronn-Mills' book Transgender Lives: Complex Stories, Complex Voices, which simply states that individuals prefer to be flexible regarding their gender. Other modern definitions are included in the Urban Dictionary, with the earliest example being added in 2007.\r\n\r\nThe first genderfluid flag was seen in 2005 at the gay pride in Columbus, Ohio.

The three major types are:\r\n\r\n- Sex-repulsed: Someone who is repulsed by or completely disinterested in the idea of sex.\r\n- Sex-neutral: Someone who isn’t repulsed by sex but also doesn’t actively seek it out. These people may still have sex if, for example, they’re in a relationship and want to please their partner.\r\n- Sex-positive: Someone who identifies as asexual, meaning they don’t feel sexual attraction to others, but will still have sex for pleasure.\r\n\r\nAs the name implies, Greysexuality is somewhat hard to define, a sexual grey area. The term is intentionally vague to accommodate the people who fall somewhere between asexual and sexual. They might experience sexual attraction once in a while but largely don’t. This might mean they have certain circumstances where they might feel attraction, which they might be able to easily define, but are non-negotiable.\r\n\r\nA Greysexual person may have a history of sexual experience that doesn’t reflect their current sexual identity or sense of self. Others might identify with Greysexuality because they experience infrequent sexual attraction that’s not strong enough to act on or pursue.\r\n\r\nSexuality, including Greysexuality, is unique to each individual. However, some common Greysexual characteristics include:\r\n\r\n- Not prioritizing sexual attraction when choosing a romantic partner.\r\n- Not viewing sex as important.\r\n- Feeling sexual attraction occasionally, but not often.\r\n- Showing love and affection for their partner in non-sexual ways, like cuddling or talking.\r\n\r\nPeople who identify as Demisexual only experience sexual attraction after they’ve formed a close emotional bond with someone. This is different from only feeling sexual attraction rarely.\r\n\r\nThere are two levels of attraction people can commonly experience: primary and secondary. Primary attraction has to do with physical traits, such as how a person looks or smells. Secondary attraction develops over time and has to do with an emotional investment in another person. Demisexuals only experience secondary attraction.\r\n\r\nGreysexual only experience sexual attraction some of the time, and sometimes not at all. Their level of sexual attraction could fall anywhere from “not normally, but sometimes,” to “enjoys sex only under very specific circumstances”.\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes, the same person will move between these two places, and others, on the sexuality spectrum during their lifetime.\r\n\r\nMany of the misconceptions around Greysexuality are the same as those around asexuality. People may think asexual and Greysexual people “just haven’t found the right person” or that they’re going through a phase. However, asexuality and Greysexuality are sexual orientations.\r\n\r\nAnother myth is that people who are asexual or Greysexual can’t enjoy sex. They actually can, and sometimes seek it out. Asexual and Greysexual people may enjoy sex itself without experiencing sexual attraction.\r\n\r\nGreysexual and asexual people may enjoy sex with their partner for the bonding and physical stimulation. However, they may not feel an intrinsic need for sex, because it may not interest them. Even if they aren’t interested in sex for themselves, however, Greysexual may take part in sex if it pleases their partner and makes them feel loved.\r\n\r\nGreysexual people may also decide to have sex because they want to have children. The choice of how much, or how little, sex they have is up to the individual.\r\n\r\nGreysexual people can also be attracted to others romantically, but not sexually. They may pursue romantic relationships that are minimally sexual or not sexual at all.\r\n\r\nThis had led to the separation of romantic and sexual orientations, as someone can be asexual but still seek out romantic affection. It is still completely possible for Greysexual people to have relationships with one another, or with someone who is sexual.\r\n\r\nThe concept of grey-asexuality developed in the early 2000s on the AVEN forums. In 2003, an AVEN member proposed the concept of \"semisexuality,\" naming a half-way point between being asexual and not. Later, in 2006, AVEN member KSpaz proposed the term \"gray-a\" to describe the \"fuzzy\" space in the asexual spectrum.\r\n\r\nThe Greysexual flag was designed by Milith Rusignuolo and was via upload to Wikipedia on June 21, 2013. It was supposed to be symbolic of someone starting out with no sexual attraction, represented by purple representing asexuality, then entering a single episode of it attraction (grey to white) with white representing Allosexuality from the asexual flag, and then going back to being Asexual.\r\n\r\nOn December 3rd, 2020 a second Greysexual flag was coined by a user going by Angel. The darker shades represent occasional sexual attraction, the mid-way shades represent being on the ace spectrum, the lightest shades represent feeling no sexual attraction, and the white represents community.\r\n\r\nThe second alternate Greysexual flag was designed by Reddit user U/AkidIguess on November 22, 2020.\r\n\r\nThe third alternate Greysexual flag was designed by Reddit user u/adeltae on April 19, 2021. The black represents no sexual attraction, the dark grey represents very little sexual attraction, the purple represents conditional sexual attraction, the light grey represents some sexual attraction, but not as much as allosexual people, and the white represents community.";

An example of non-juvelic orientation would be bisexual, because it does not specify the gender of the bisexual person- anyone can be bisexual, regardless of their gender.\r\n\r\nAll the orientations in the gender-loving-gender format are inherently juvelic because they're based on telling one's own gender and the gender(s) of the people one is attracted to. However not all juvelic orientations are in the gender-loving-gender format. The GLG format is specifically for terms that are non-exclusive and explicitly use the format of GLG. Terms such as feminamoric, marsic, venusic, and viramoric are all examples of juvelic orientations that don't explicitly use the GLG system.\r\n\r\nJuvelic orientations most commonly refer to men, women, and non-binary (or some combination of those three), however any gender(s) can be used when describing a juvelic orientation. Juvelic orientations can also be used by a-spec individuals, as juvelic orientations can be used to refer to sexual orientation, romantic orientation, or any tertiary attractions one has.\r\n\r\nJuvelic was coined by Twilightvelvet on Wordpress on June 4, 2018.

Most often, butches take on masculine roles and careers that are typically designated to men within their culture and time period. Butch originally referred to a style and gender role performed by masculine lesbians, and is still often associated with the lesbian community, but its usage and meaning have expanded and are not exclusive to lesbians. In current usage, butch sometimes refers to a particular non-binary gender identity.\r\n\r\nButch has similarities with boi, transmasculine, and other masculine of center identities. It is often understood on a spectrum of butch to femme. One variation is \"soft butch,\" a masculine expression that is closer to neutrality than extreme masculinity.\r\n\r\nThe word butch may have been coined by abbreviating the word butcher, as first noted in George Cassidy's nickname, Butch Cassidy. The specific term was first coined in the 1940s by lesbian and queer women, but the concept developed earlier.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, butch/femme roles were common in lesbian communities during the first half of the 20th century.\r\n\r\nOn June 27, 2017, Mod Q of the Tumblr blog butch positivity (butchspace) and Tumblr user princechaotic posted a seven-striped orange and yellow butch flag design. The color meanings are as follows (posted June 30, 2017):\r\n\r\n- Red: Passion and sexuality; inspired by the meaning of red in Gilbert Baker's pride flag and the complicated yet passionate ways butches relate to their sexualities.\r\n- Red Orange: Courage; being butch is often stigmatized—it symbolizes the strength butches share in learning to find and love themselves.\r\n- Light Orange: Joy; the color is light and soft and symbolizes the joy of being butch that comes despite the hardships.\r\n- White: Renewal; discovering oneself as butch is a sort of rebirth and marks the beginning of a new existence.\r\n- Beige: Chivalry; butches have a kind and chivalrous nature—they seek to protect others.\r\n- Orange: Warmth; how warm butches and butchness can be; finding comfort in being butch.\r\n- Brown: Honesty; butches admitting to themselves it is who they are.\r\n\r\nAlthough working class butch/femme culture of the 1940s and 1950s was not a simple imitation of heterosexuality, that assumption led to stereotyping and dismissal by many lesbian feminists, the medical establishment, and more affluent lesbians and gay men. The dominant discourse of feminism and lesbian feminism in the 1970s and early 1980s regarded butch/femme communities as incompatible with feminism and marginalized them in lesbian history. From that perspective, butch/femme roles were criticized as reproducing patriarchy and hierarchies within women's relationships; they were not seen as being distinct, transformative, or a form of resistance to the oppression of women.\r\n\r\nIn the 20th anniversary edition of Boots of Leather, Slippers of Gold: The History of a Lesbian Community co-author Elizabeth Lapovsky Kennedy noted that there is more work to be done regarding the history of transgender men. Masculine-presenting people who were assumed to be butch women may have been trans men or otherwise had a different understanding of their gender. The assumptions of gender led to mistakes in documentation, oversimplifying a history that is more complicated.";

TLT can be used in combination with other orientations (for example a TLT lesbian would be a trans woman who prioritizes relationships with other trans women).\r\n\r\nThe unwillingness to date cis men/women is not due to any inherent difference between cis and trans men/women; rather, it stems from issues of safety, trauma, oppression, or other personal reasons. One may prefer a trans partner because one would relate to them more. One may also not want to be vulnerable to misconceptions, misgendering, or oppression from a cisgender partner.\r\n\r\nThe first T4T was created by mod Kau at Tumblr blog Beyond-MOGAI-Pride-Flags on May 31, 2018, adjusted by polyamaesthetic in June 2020. Another flag was created by Tumblr user guiltyidealist and has the colors pink, blue, and yellow as the core colors to respectively represent trans women, trans men, and nonbinary individuals as well as diversity and inclusivity. The TM4TM and TW4TW flags were made by mod Kau of Beyond-MOGAI-Pride-Flags on Tumblr. Another T4T flag was made by Ian and Nio of t4tpos on Twitter. This flag is controversial due to its creators being m-spec lesbian and gay exclusionists.";

The birth assignment—generally defaulting to assigned male at birth (AMAB) or assigned female at birth (AFAB)—assumes that the individual's gender identity will correspond to their assigned sex. A person's gender identity—their sense of gender—usually develops when they are very young. The realization that their gender is different from what they were assigned can occur as early as three years old or in childhood prior to the onset of puberty. It may also happen later in life.\r\n\r\nTransgender people can be binary or non-binary. Some transgender individuals may experience at least one form of gender dysphoria during their life, usually manifesting as an intense distress with their assigned gender. However, not all transgender people experience gender dysphoria. Conversely, some transgender individuals may experience what is known as gender euphoria, a term used to describe a \"positive and exciting feeling of one's gendered self\".
