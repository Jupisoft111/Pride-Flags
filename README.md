#Pride-Flags by Jupisoft is an application that can generate almost all the existing LGBTQIA+ flags and export them as PNG, among other things. Currently it includes 335 flags, and it also has several options to export as PNG all the flags at once, or only the desired ones in a circumference. This tool was heavily inspired by the project from the LGBTQIA+ people at Microsoft here: https://github.com/microsoft/Pride-flag. Feel free to send any suggestions :-)
