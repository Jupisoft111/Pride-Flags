# Pride Flags can show and export to PNG most of the LGBTQIA+ flags

Currently it includes 414 flags, and it also has several options to export as PNG all the flags at once, or only the desired ones in a circumference. This tool was heavily inspired by the project from the LGBTQIA+ people at Microsoft here: https://github.com/microsoft/Pride-flag. Feel free to send any suggestions :-)

Note: look at each release to see the latest changes and updates!
