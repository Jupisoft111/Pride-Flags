# Pride Flags can show and export to PNG most of the LGBTQIA+ flags

Currently it includes 414 flags, and it also has several options to export as PNG all the flags at once, or only the desired ones in a circumference. It can also apply any desired waving to any flag and control all the aspects of the waves. Now it also includes an option to drag and drop any image into the tool to automatically compare that image to all the known flags to properly guess which flag contained the dropped image. The first time will be a bit slower, since it will generate a cahce of all the known flags, but the second and next times it will always be super fast. This tool was heavily inspired by the project from the LGBTQIA+ people at Microsoft here: https://github.com/microsoft/Pride-flag. Feel free to send any suggestions :-)
